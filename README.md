This is List of Crossmodal Perception and Plasticity lab (CPP) PsychToolBox (PTB) toolbox.

Those functions are mostly wrappers around some PTB functions to facilitate their use and to have a codebase to facilitate their reuse.


## Requirements

Make sure that the following toolboxes are installed and added to the matlab / octave path.

For instructions see the following links:

| Requirements                                             | Used version |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [PsychToolBox](http://psychtoolbox.org/)  Duuuuhh        | >=3.0.14     |
| [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) | 201??        |
| or [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)        | 4.?          |

The exact version required for this to work but it is known to work with:
-   matlab 2017a or octave 4.2.2 and PTB 3.0.16.

## Code guidestyle

We use the `camelCase` to more easily differentiates our functions from the ones from PTB that use a `PascalCase`.

We keep the McCabe complexity as reported by the [check_my_code function](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/matlab_checkcode) below 15.

## How to install

### Use the matlab package manager

This repository can be added as a dependencies by listing it in a [mpm-requirements.txt file](.mpm-requirements.txt)
as follows:

    CPP_PTB -u https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB.git

You can then use the [matlab package manager](https://github.com/mobeets/mpm), to simply download the appropriate version of those dependencies and add them to your path by running a `getDependencies` function like the one below where you just need to replace `YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME` by the name of your experiment.

```matlab
  function getDependencies(action)
  % Will install on your computer the matlab dependencies specified in the mpm-requirements.txt
  %  and add them to the matlab path. The path is never saved so you need to run getDependencies() when
  %  you start matlab.
  %
  % getDependencies('update') will force the update and overwrite previous version of the dependencies.
  %
  % getDependencies() If you only already have the appropriate version but just want to add them to the matlab path.

  experimentName = YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME;

  if nargin<1
      action = '';
  end

  switch action
      case 'update'
          % install dependencies
          mpm install -i mpm-requirements.txt -f -c YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME
  end

  % adds them to the path
  mpm_folder = fileparts(which('mpm'));
  addpath(genpath(fullfile(mpm_folder, 'mpm-packages', 'mpm-collections', experimentName)));

  end
```

## Setting up keyboards

To select a specific keyboard to be used by the experimenter or the participant, you need to know
the value assigned by PTB to each keyboard device.

To know this copy-paste this on the command window:

``` matlab
[keyboardNumbers, keyboardNames] = GetKeyboardIndices;

disp(keyboardNumbers);
disp(keyboardNames);
```

You can then assign a specific device number to the main keyboard or the response box in the `cfg` structure

-   `cfg.keyboard.responseBox` would be the device number of the device used by the participant to give his/her
response: like the button box in the scanner or a separate keyboard for a behavioral experiment
-   `cfg.keyboard.keyboard` would be the device number of the keyboard on which the experimenter will type or
press the keys necessary to start or abort the experiment.

`cfg.keyboard.responseBox` and `cfg.keyboard.keyboard` can be different or the same.

Using empty vectors (ie `[]`) or a negative value for those means that you will let PTB find and use the default device.

## Structure and function details

<!-- ### setParameters -->

### initPTB

This will initialize PsychToolBox

-   screen
-   the windon opened takes the whole screen by default
-   set in debug mode with window transparency if necessary
-   can skip synch test if you ask for it (nicely)
-   gets the flip interval
-   computes the pixel per degree of visual angle
-   set font details
-   keyboard
-   sound

### testKeyboards

Checks that the keyboards asked for properly connected.

If no key is pressed on the correct keyboard after the timeOut time this exits with an error.

### cleanUp

A wrapper function to close all windows, ports, show mouse cursor, close keyboard queues
and give access back to the keyboards.

### getResponse

It is wrapper function to use `KbQueue` which is definitely what you should used to collect responses.

You can easily collect responses while running some other code at the same time.

It will only take responses from the `response box` which can simply be the "main keyboard" or
another keyboard connected to the computer or the response box that the participant is using.

You can use it in a way so that it only takes responses from certain keys and ignore others (like
the triggers from an MRI scanner).

If you want to know more on how to use it check its help section and the `CPP_getResponseDemo.m`.

To select a specific keyboard to be used by the experimenter or the participant, you need to know
the value assigned by PTB to each keyboard device.

To know this copy-paste this on the command window:

    [keyboardNumbers, keyboardNames] = GetKeyboardIndices;

    keyboardNumbers
    keyboardNames

### deg2Pix

For a given field value in degrees of visual angle in the input `structure`,
this computes its value in pixel using the pixel per degree value of the `cfg` structure
and returns a structure with an additional field with Pix suffix holding that new value.

### drawFixationCross

Define the parameters of the fixation cross in `cfg` and `expParameters` and this does the rest.

### eyeTracker

This will handle the Eye Tracker (EyeLink set up) and can be called to initialize the connection and start the calibration, start/stop eye(s) movement recordings and save the `*.edf` file (named with BIDS specification from cpp-lln-lab/CPP_BIDS).  

### pressSpace4me

Use that to stop your script and only restart when the space bar is pressed.

## Annexes

### Experiment template [ WIP ]

### `devSandobox.m` stand-alone

This script is a stand-alone function that can be useful as a sandbox to develop the PTB audio/visual stimulation of your experiment. No input/output required.

Here, a tutorial from https://peterscarfe.com/contrastgratingdemo.html is provided for illustrative purpose (notice that some variable names are updated to our code style). For your use, you will delete that part.

It is composed of two parts:
 - a fixed structure that will initialize and close PTB in 'debug mode'
    (`PsychDebugWindowConfiguration`, `SkipSyncTests`)
 - the actual sandbox where to set your dynamic variables (the stimulation
   parameters) and the 'playground' where to develop the stimulation code

 When you are happy with it, ideally you will move the vars in `setParameters.m` and the stimulation code in a separate function in `my-experiment-folder/subfun`. The code style and variable names are the same used in `cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB` github repo, therefore it should be easy to move everything in your experiment scripts (see the template that is annexed in `cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB`).
