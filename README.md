This is List of Crossmodal Perception and Plasticity lab (CPP) PsychToolBox (PTB) toolbox.

Those functions are mostly wrappers around some PTB functions to facilitate their use and to have a codebase to facilitate their reuse.


## Requirements

Make sure that the following toolboxes are installed and added to the matlab / octave path.

For instructions see the following links:

| Requirements                                             | Used version |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [PsychToolBox](http://psychtoolbox.org/)  Duuuuhh        | >=3.0.14     |
| [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) | 201??        |
| or [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)        | 4.?          |

The exact version required for this to work but it is known to work with:
-   matlab 2017a or octave 4.2.2 and PTB 3.0.16.

## Code guidestyle

We use the `camelCase` to more easily differentiates our functions from the ones from PTB that use a `PascalCase`.
We use the following regular expression for function names: `[a-z]+(([A-Z]|[0-9]){1}[a-z]+)*`.

We keep the McCabe complexity as reported by the [check_my_code function](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/check_my_code) below 15.

We use the [MISS_HIT linter](https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/style_checker.html) to automatically fix some linting issues.

## How to install

### Download with git

``` bash
cd fullpath_to_directory_where_to_install
# use git to download the code
git clone https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB.git
# move into the folder you have just created
cd CPP_PTB
# add the src folder to the matlab path and save the path
matlab -nojvm -nosplash -r "addpath(fullfile(pwd)); savepath ();"
```

Then get the latest commit:
```bash
# from the directory where you downloaded the code
git pull origin master
```

To work with a specific version, create a branch at a specific version tag number
```bash
# creating and checking out a branch that will be calle version1 at the version tag v0.0.1
git checkout -b version1 v0.0.1
```

### Add as a submodule

Add it as a submodule in the repo you are working on.

``` bash
cd fullpath_to_directory_where_to_install
# use git to download the code
git submodule add https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB.git
# move into the folder you have just created
cd CPP_PTB
# add the src folder to the matlab path and save the path
matlab -nojvm -nosplash -r "addpath(fullfile(pwd))"
```

To get the latest commit you then need to update the submodule with the information
on its remote repository and then merge those locally.
```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Remember that updates to submodules need to be committed as well.

#### Example for submodule usage

So say you want to clone a repo that has some nested submodules, then you would type this to get the content of all the submodules at once (here with my experiment repo):
``` bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/user_name/yourExperiment.git
```
This would be the way to do it "by hand"

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/user_name/yourExperiment.git

# go into the directory
cd yourExperiment

# initialize and get the content of the first level of submodules  (CPP_PTB and CPP_BIDS)
git submodule init
git submodule update

# get the nested submodules JSONio and BIDS-matlab for CPP_BIDS
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git submodule init'
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git submodule update'
```
**TO DO**
<!-- Submodules
pros: in principle, downloading the experiment you have the whole package plus the benefit to stay updated and use version control of this dependency. Can probably handle a use case in which one uses different version on different projects (e.g. older and newer projects).
cons: for pro users and not super clear how to use it at the moment. -->

### Direct download

Download the code. Unzip. And add to the matlab path.

Pick a specific version:

https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB/releases

Or take the latest commit (NOT RECOMMENDED):

https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB/archive/master.zip

**TO DO**
<!-- Download a specific version and c/p it in a subfun folder
pros: the easiest solution to share the code and 'installing' it on the stimulation computer (usually not the one used to develop the code).
cons: extreme solution useful only at the very latest stage (i.e. one minute before acquiring your data); prone to be customized/modified (is it what we want?) -->

## Setting up keyboards

To select a specific keyboard to be used by the experimenter or the participant, you need to know
the value assigned by PTB to each keyboard device.

To know this copy-paste this on the command window:

``` matlab
[keyboardNumbers, keyboardNames] = GetKeyboardIndices;

disp(keyboardNumbers);
disp(keyboardNames);
```

You can then assign a specific device number to the main keyboard or the response box in the `cfg` structure

-   `cfg.keyboard.responseBox` would be the device number of the device used by the participant to give his/her
response: like the button box in the scanner or a separate keyboard for a behavioral experiment
-   `cfg.keyboard.keyboard` would be the device number of the keyboard on which the experimenter will type or
press the keys necessary to start or abort the experiment.

`cfg.keyboard.responseBox` and `cfg.keyboard.keyboard` can be different or the same.

Using empty vectors (ie `[]`) or a negative value for those means that you will let PTB find and use the default device.

## Structure

```matlab

cfg.testingDevice = 'pc';

% cfg.color
cfg.keyboard.keyboard = [];
cfg.keyboard.responseBox = [];
cfg.keyboard.responseKey = {};
cfg.keyboard.escapeKey = 'ESCAPE';

% cfg.debug
cfg.debug.do = true;
cfg.debug.transpWin = true;
cfg.debug.smallWin = true;

% cfg.text
cfg.text.font
cfg.text.size
cfg.text.style

% cfg.color
cfg.color.background

% cfg.screen
cfg.screen.monitorWidth
cfg.screen.monitorDistance
cfg.screen.idx
cfg.screen.win
cfg.screen.winRect
cfg.screen.winWidth
cfg.screen.winHeight
cfg.screen.center
cfg.screen.FOV
cfg.screen.ppd
cfg.screen.ifi
cfg.screen.monRefresh

% cfg.audio
cfg.audio.do
cfg.audio.pahandle
cfg.audio.devIdx
cfg.audio.playbackMode
cfg.audio.requestedLatency
cfg.audio.fs
cfg.audio.channels
cfg.audio.initVolume
cfg.audio.pushSize  
cfg.audio.requestOffsetTime
cfg.audio.reqsSampleOffset

% cfg.mri
cfg.mri.repetitionTime
cfg.mri.triggerNb
cfg.mri.triggerKey
```

## function details


### initPTB

This will initialize PsychToolBox

-   screen
-   the windon opened takes the whole screen by default
-   set in debug mode with window transparency if necessary
-   can skip synch test if you ask for it (nicely)
-   gets the flip interval
-   computes the pixel per degree of visual angle
-   set font details
-   keyboard
-   sound

### testKeyboards

Checks that the keyboards asked for properly connected.

If no key is pressed on the correct keyboard after the timeOut time this exits with an error.

### cleanUp

A wrapper function to close all windows, ports, show mouse cursor, close keyboard queues
and give access back to the keyboards.

### getResponse

It is wrapper function to use `KbQueue` which is definitely what you should use to collect responses.

You can easily collect responses while running some other code at the same time.

It will only take responses from one device which can simply be the "main keyboard"
(the default device that PTB will find) or another keyboard connected to the computer
or the response box that the participant is using.

You can use it in a way so that it only takes responses from certain keys and ignore others (like
the triggers from an MRI scanner).

If you want to know more on how to use it check its help section and the `CPP_getResponseDemo.m`.

In brief, there are several actions you can execute with this function.

-   init: initialize the buffer for key presses on a given device (you can also specify the keys of interest that should be listened to).
-   start: start listening to the key presses (carefully insert into your script - where do you want to start buffering the responses).
-   check: till that point, it will check the buffer for all key presses.
    -   It only reports presses on the keys of interest mentioned at initialization.
    -   It **can** also check for presses on the escape key and abort if the escape key is part of the keys of interest.
-   flush: Empties the buffer of key presses in case you want to discard any previous key presses.
-   stop: Stops buffering key presses. You can still restart by calling "start" again.
-   release: Closes the buffer for good.



### deg2Pix

For a given field value in degrees of visual angle in the input `structure`,
this computes its value in pixel using the pixel per degree value of the `cfg` structure
and returns a structure with an additional field with Pix suffix holding that new value.

### drawFixationCross

Define the parameters of the fixation cross in `cfg` and `expParameters` and this does the rest.

### eyeTracker

This will handle the Eye Tracker (EyeLink set up) and can be called to initialize the connection and start the calibration, start/stop eye(s) movement recordings and save the `*.edf` file (named with BIDS specification from cpp-lln-lab/CPP_BIDS).  

### pressSpace4me

Use that to stop your script and only restart when the space bar is pressed.

### standByScreen

It shows a basic one-page instruction stored in `cfg.task.instruction`.

### waitForTrigger

Counts a certain number of triggers coming from the mri/scanner before returning.
Requires number of triggers to wait for.


## Annexes

### Experiment template [ WIP ]

### devSandbox (stand-alone)

This script is a stand-alone function that can be useful as a sandbox to develop the PTB audio/visual stimulation of your experiment. No input/output required.

Here, a tutorial from https://peterscarfe.com/contrastgratingdemo.html is provided for illustrative purpose (notice that some variable names are updated to our code style). For your use, you will delete that part.

It is composed of two parts:
 - a fixed structure that will initialize and close PTB in 'debug mode'
    (`PsychDebugWindowConfiguration`, `SkipSyncTests`)
 - the actual sandbox where to set your dynamic variables (the stimulation
   parameters) and the 'playground' where to develop the stimulation code

 When you are happy with it, ideally you will move the vars in `setParameters.m` and the stimulation code in a separate function in `my-experiment-folder/subfun`. The code style and variable names are the same used in `cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB` github repo, therefore it should be easy to move everything in your experiment scripts (see the template that is annexed in `cpp-lln-lab/CPP_PTB`).
